Essentially we need a set of definitions on our jobs which will execute the necessary steps in our smart contracts.

For the purpose of our project, we will need to define the jobs:

1. Fetching the data from our API, saving that data onto our smart contract
2. Checking whether to payout smart contract or not, this can be through 2 ways
    a. Check whether or not expiration date past
    b. Check whether a certain threshhold value has been made
3. Pay out appropriate party.
